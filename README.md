# WhereAmI_app

This is a React Native Javascript application for a simple and fun location guessing game. The user is presented with 5 different photos of locations, and must guess the correct location within 5 attempts. Each day, a new set of 5 photos will be displayed.

# **Getting Started**  
Clone the repository to your local machine.  
Install the necessary dependencies by running the command npm install in the project directory.  
Run the command npm start to start the development server.  

# **Usage**  
Open the app on your mobile device or emulator.  
A photo of a location will be displayed on the screen.  
Enter your guess into the input field and submit by pressing the "Submit" button.  
If your guess is correct, a modal will be displayed with the message "Bingo".
Click the "OK" button on the modal to close it and move on to the next photo.  
After 5 incorrect attempts, a modal will be displayed with the message "No Bueno".
However, you will still be able to attempt all photos from that day; there are 5 locations per day. If not, there's always tomorrow.
